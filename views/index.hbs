                Until After is a private journal that unlocks when you die.
                We spend the most amount of time in our lives digitally and when we die, it all just dissapears.
                All your amazing ideas and deepest secrets, just gone... and that's ridiculous! Until After checks
                your mood every day and keeps track of your life defining moments along with your daily journals so
                that when you die, your life can be remembered for what it truly was.
                We're launching soon.
                Sign up be to one of our first beta users. Donations (click the top right button) are also greatly appreciated to help
                us kick start the app as this will be free to use for the time being and our team is dedicating

                Hi, my name is Asim and I'm creating Until After because I'm scared,
                I'm scared I won't live to see tomorrow. The notes app in my phone has been my clutch.
                When I'm feeling lost, I write in it. When I need to have a talk with someone, I write down
                all my raw thoughts down there. When I have a crazy idea, I jot it down there... Unfortunately,
                I never get a chance to go back and view all my notes because scrolling through them one by one
                is really tedius. Even more sad, I don't think anyone will ever read through them. Journaling
                has basically saved my life and I hope it can save someone else. It's such a healthy outlet for me
                to poor out my thoughts knowning no one will see this. Over time, I've become more serious about daily
                journaling my experiences and emotions but I've never had a good way to easily digest all the unique information
                I've created over the months and years. I've had countless life defining moments, but over time, they all
                blend in and it's hard for me to reflect on my life trajectory. Recently, I thought to myself, I would love to make my journal
                public to the world when I die. What better way for me to leave behind my legacy than to literally leave behind
                my own documentary in a journal. A journal that can tell people the truth of my life for what it really was.
                After all, I'll be dead so who gives a fuck. If someone wants to spend their time reading and thinking about me,
                why on earth would I not let them, I'm dead! I hope my great great grand children can go through my Until After
                someday, hell maybe even give it a mention in their own Until Afters. Maybe they'll be reading mine and my wifes
                Until Afters and comparing how both of us came together in each of our own eyes. Maybe, Until After will be something
                beautiful.
